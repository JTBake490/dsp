[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)
The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their PMF.  What goes wrong?

Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

>>rand_nums = np.random.random (1000)

>>pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand_nums)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)

>>'''The PMF plot bring up too many data points that it's near.
impossible to distinguish any trends. There are so many
data points, that noise is rendering the plot useless.'''

>>cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand_nums)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
