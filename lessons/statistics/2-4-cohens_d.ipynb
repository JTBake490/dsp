Using the variable `totalwgt_lb`, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. 

Compute Cohenâ€™s effect size to quantify the difference between the groups.  How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)

'''The first pregnancy length tends to be fractionally shorter.
Based on the dataset provided, it would be very hard to conclude that first
pregnancies are longer.'''
